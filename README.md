# Patch analysis feature

This git repository contains the sourcecode for the Android patch analysis testing.
This code enables evaluating your current Android device's patch status and helps to gain a visual overview and find missing patches.
It is used as a reusable git submodule and library e.g. in our Android SnoopSnitch app (https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/snoopsnitch)

Please refer to our FAQ here to find some answers to questions, which might occur when using this library:
